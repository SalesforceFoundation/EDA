* Batch process looks at all Course Offerings and their related Course
* Connections. It assigns all current Faculty attached to Course Offerings
* to the Default Faculty RecordType and marks it as Primary. After it attaches
* all Faculty it will convert all other Course Connections without a RecordType
* to the Default Student RecordType.
