        <p>Version 1.40</p>
        <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of development in HEDA. We've tried hard to fully document our codebase so that external developers can get acclimated and quickly contribute to the project. Thanks for taking the time to review this documentation and consider contributing to the project!</p>
