    <h2> Global API</h2>
    <p>The global API is intended for use running in Salesforce, but outside the managed package. This could be custom code running
        in the org, or code in third-party applications installer in the org. It includes the following classes: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>TDTM_Runnable - Abstract class that classes to be run from a trigger, according to the TDTM design, need to extend.</li>
        <li>TDTM_Global_API - Provides methods to call the Trigger Handler class, which in turns calls the classes that need to
            run for each DML action on a set of records, and to retrieve the default EDA TDTM configuration.</li>
    </ul>
