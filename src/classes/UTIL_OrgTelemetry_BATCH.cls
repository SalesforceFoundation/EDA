* @description A more controllable method to handle the asynchronous submission of Telemetry data to the LMO
* without having to worry about governor limits when it comes to querying large datasets in LDV orgs. By iterating
* through a custom List<> of Enum Types with a batch size of ONE, the execute() method can call a service method
* to handle querying and submitting the specific telemetry data only for that Enum type. If for some reason that
* one query were to fail, which is theoretically possible in a huge organization where there may be other jobs
* executing or other factors at play, the rest of this job will continue. That ensures that our LMO collects as much
* data as possible. In addition, it can help us identify which specific telemetry data processes are failing.
*
* Uses "without sharing" so that it has full rights to query all records in all objects.
* This is needed to ensure a consistent return of telemetry data even if the process is
* called by different users with different permissions. Specifie PII is never queried or
* returned by this class.
