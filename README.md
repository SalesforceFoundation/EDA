Education Data Architecture (EDA) standardizes the starting point for educational institutions building out a CRM.  It provides a core and common data model that supports the entire K-20 student journey. It's an open-source architecture—anyone can view the source code in GitHub. It's been developed in close collaboration with our customers, partners, and the K-20 community to foster common acceptance. Solutions built on EDA share the same open and flexible, extendable framework that accommodates a range of use cases and end-user customization. With EDA, you get an architecture along with preconfigured objects, logic and functionality, and automation, tailored for education right out of the box.

The EDA framework, supported by the Salesforce Platform, can serve as the foundation for managing data and data relationships across your entire institution.

As an open-source project, we welcome your feedback on and contributions to EDA. 

## Get EDA

Install EDA in any Salesforce Developer Edition, Enterprise Edition, or Sandbox org.

## Contribute Code Using Prettier

Use Prettier to format code contributed to EDA. To get started with Prettier, in a command line interface, run `yarn install`. The following packages will be installed:

* prettier

If you encounter errors, remove the node_modules folder and run `yarn install` again.

You can customize Prettier files in .prettierrc.yml and specify code that Prettier will ignore in .prettierignore.
