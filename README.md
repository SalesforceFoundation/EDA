Education Data Architecture (EDA) standardizes the starting point for educational institutions building out a CRM. It provides a core and common data model that supports the entire K-20 student journey. It's an open-source architecture—meaning anyone can view the source code in GitHub. It's been developed in close collaboration with our customers, partners, and the K-20 community to foster common acceptance. Solutions built on EDA share the same open and flexible, extensible framework that accommodates a range of use cases and end-user customization. With EDA, you get a standardized data model—including preconfigured objects, functionality, logic, and automation—tailored for education right out of the box.

The EDA framework, supported by the Salesforce Platform, can serve as the foundation for managing data and data relationships across your entire institution. We welcome your feedback and contributions to EDA.
