The Salesforce Higher Education Data Architecture (HEDA) Project (HEDAP) provides an Higher-Ed-specific platform for growth for organizations utilizing Salesforce.  HEDA utilizes a Salesforce managed package and some light unmanaged customization to give Higher Education users a familiar nomenclature and data model for many higher education applications.  In addition, Higher Education developers and administrators can utilize HEDA's advanced trigger management capabilities, robust error handling and pluggable framework to better manage and coordinate the data in their Salesforce instance.

HEDA is built from industry-wide best practices used across higher education and the Salesforce ecosystem and we welcome feedback and contributions for the project. See below for more information on how to get involved.
