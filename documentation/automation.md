| Development (Namespaced)  | `dev_org_namespaced` | `dev_namespaced` |         | ✔         |
| QA                        | `qa_org`             | `dev`            |         |           |
| Regression                | `regression_org`     | `release`        | ✔       |           |
| Regression (Push Upgrade) | `upgraded_org`       | `release`        | ✔       |           |

### Testing Scenarios

#### Regression testing

Regression testing the latest beta:

    git checkout master
    git pull
    cci org scratch release <orgname> --default
    cci flow run regression_org 
    cci org browser <orgname>

Regression Testing a Net New Org:

    git checkout master
    git pull
    cci org scratch release <orgname> --default
    cci flow run new_org
    cci org browser <orgname>

Testing an org that has been push upgraded from the latest release and has received the latest managed package from EDA (Represents an "Existing Org"):

    git checkout master
    git pull
    cci org scratch release <orgname> --default
    cci flow run upgraded_org 
    cci org browser <orgname>

## Utility Tasks and Flows

### Flows

-   **`edaectomy`:** Removes configuration and unmanaged metadata.
-   **`setup_encryption`:** Sets up Shield Platform Encryption in the target Org. It is recommended that this flow be run in developer scratch orgs only.
-   **`new_org`** Simulates an org that has been given the latest beta release of EDA and underlying dependencies.
-   **`upgraded_org`** Simulates an org that has been push-upgraded to the latest releases of EDA and underlying dependencies.

### Tasks

-   **`execute_install_apex`:** Runs most of the install script methods from STG<sub>InstallScript</sub> class.
-   **`delete_dev_config`:** Deploys metadata found under `unpackaged/config/dev_delete` Removes the Record type visibilities, page layout assignments Required to remove an installed beta.

## Unpackaged Metadata

Unpackaged directory structure:

    unpackaged/config
    ├── analytics
    ├── dev
    ├── dev_delete
    ├── qa
    └── spe

Each directory is used as follows:

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| `config/analytics`  | Einstein Analytics R&A templates        | `deploy_einstein_templates` |                       |
| `config/dev`        | Development metadata                    | `deploy_dev_config`         | `retrieve_config_dev` |
| `config/dev_delete` | Deletes development metadata            | `delete_dev_config`         |                       |
| `config/qa`         | QA metadata                             | `deploy_qa_config`          | `retrieve_qa_config`  |
